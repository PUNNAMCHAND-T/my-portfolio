              Hi, I'm Punnam Chand, a curious and enthusiastic Person with a passion for exploring the world.


          I'm always eager to discover new places, immerse myself in different cultures, and experience the unique beauty of diverse landscapes.

         When I'm not traveling or exploring the tech world, you might find me behind the wheel, enjoying the freedom of the open road.
